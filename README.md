# Minimalist Purple CSS Framework
The goal of this project is to create a minimalist CSS framework that provides basic styling for common web elements such as typography, images, buttons, links, and text inputs. The framework is easy to integrate into existing projects by simply dragging and dropping the stylesheet. It also offers customization options through the use of CSS variables for color palettes and spacing. Additionally, the project includes a showcase page to demonstrate the appearance of various elements styled with the framework, making it easier for potential users to visualize its capabilities. Overall, the aim is to provide a simple yet versatile solution for styling web projects with consistent and modern design elements.
